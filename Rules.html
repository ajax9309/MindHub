                    <p class="introp2">The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
                        youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
                        team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
                        this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                        background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</p>

                            dimensions within
                            a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be
                            adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</li>
                        <li class="li1"><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS</strong>. Fields used within the competition program
                            must be
                            a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in
                            the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                            minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                            assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                            whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                            from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
                            field may be required to play all their games away.</li>
